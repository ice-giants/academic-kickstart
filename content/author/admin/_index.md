The Ice Giants, **Uranus and Neptune**, are the least explored class of planets in our Solar System, having been visited only once by a passing spacecraft, Voyager 2.  These distant Ice Giant Systems may be hiding secrets that could reveal the origins of our Solar System, and are our nearest and best representatives of a type of planet that is commonplace in our universe.

In January 2020, Planetary Scientists from around the world will meet at London's prestigious [Royal Society](https://royalsociety.org/) for a three-day workshop on the future exploration of the Uranus and Neptune systems.  We will aim to shape the key scientific questions that will drive mission planning in the coming decade, aiming to make use of ideal launch opportunities around 2030.  

Here's what you need to do now to join us in London:

1. Register for the free, two-day plenary meeting on January 20th-21st at the Royal Society via [this link.](https://royalsociety.org/science-events-and-lectures/2020/01/ice-giants/)
1. Register for the one-day splinter meetings on January 22nd at Burlington House (see below) via [this link](https://shop.le.ac.uk/product-catalogue/events-at-leicester/department-of-physics-and-astronomy/ice-giant-systems-2020-splinter-meeting-registration) - a small fee will be charged to cover venue hire and catering.
1. Submit a poster and/or splinter meeting abstract by following the instructions on [this form](https://github.com/ice-giants/papers/blob/master/IG2020_abstractform.docx) and sending it to [ice-giants@le.ac.uk](mailto:ice-giants@le.ac.uk) before 12:00 GMT on Tuesday December 10th 2019.
