### Overview
In March 2019, ESA released a [call for scientific themes](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/voyage-2050) as part of a long-term planning process to replace the Cosmic Vision (2015-2035).  Known as Voyage 2050, this would develop a strategy for the 2035-2050 period.  White papers are due on August 5th, 2019, to be followed by a presentation to the community in Madrid, October 29-31 2019.

Although many of us would prefer to see the start of Ice Giant mission long before 2035, this provides the community with an opportunity to make the case for missions to Uranus and Neptune.  The white paper will describe the transformative planetary science that can only be delivered via a robotic mission to these distant worlds, and the broader context within astronomy and fundamental physics.  The white paper is a significant update to those submitted as part of the [L2/L3 process](https://ice-giants.github.io/post/esa-l2-l3-proposals/) in 2013.

A preprint of the white paper is available here:
