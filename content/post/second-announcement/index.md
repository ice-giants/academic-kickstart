Dear Colleagues,

Registration and abstract submission for the Ice Giant Systems 2020 conference, hosted by London’s prestigious Royal Society, are now open.  The workshop spans Ice Giant formation, interiors, atmospheres, magnetospheres, rings and satellites, as well as mission/technology requirements and strategies for international collaboration in the coming decade.

The meeting will consist of plenary lectures (Jan 20th-21st), posters (Jan 20th), and three parallel splinter workshops (Jan 22nd).  The 2-day plenary meeting will be hosted at the Royal Society’s Carlton House Terrace, overlooking the Mall in central London.  The latter splinter meetings will be held in three of the Learned Societies of Burlington House, just off Piccadilly – the Royal Astronomical Society, the Royal Geological Society, and the Linnean Society.  Both the plenary lectures and splinter contributions will be summarised in a special edition of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A.  

Registration for the limited spaces is via a three-step process, open until December 10th 2019.  Full details are available on [our website](https://ice-giants.github.io).
